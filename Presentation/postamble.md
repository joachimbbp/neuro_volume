## Postamble
- What gives?
- Is there a really dumb typo somewhere in my code? The repo, including this branch, will be available on github.
- RTFB: I should probably read all of the [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/manual.html) and [openVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/documentation/) documentation before asking any more people for advice
	- There might be some [[Linear Algebra]] weirdness, especially with the `affine`
- But, given that the `matplotlib` output is identical, shouldn't the VDB generation be the same? A big old 3D Matrix of density data should be read the same.
