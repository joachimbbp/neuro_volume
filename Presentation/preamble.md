## Preamble:

- VDBs are volumetric data structures used in VFX for particle animation
- They are easy to animate, very art direct-able, and preserve their density data throughout the VFX pipeline
- I think they are a great alternative to the typical mesh-based MRI visualizations. These convert the original volumetric data into 3D geometry using the marching cubes algorithm
